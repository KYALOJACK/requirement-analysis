# Requirement Analysis in Software Development

This repository explores the process of **Requirement Analysis** in the software development life cycle (SDLC). The goal is to define and gather functional and non-functional requirements to ensure the successful planning and execution of a project. Here, we document key activities, techniques, and best practices to ensure that stakeholders' needs are met and that the project scope is well-defined.
